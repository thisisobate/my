Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Uche. I'm a software engineer with interests in open source, cloud-native tech, and community management. I made my first contribution to open source by participating in the Linux foundation mentorship program where I contributed to the Thanos project. Ever since, I have continued to contribute to different open source projects such as Grafana, Thanos, Pyroscope, etc. I also happens to be an active member of the CNCF where I serve as a CNCF Ambassador. I'm also the co-organizer, KCDAfrica where I help create an active community of cloud enthusiasts in the continent of Africa.
