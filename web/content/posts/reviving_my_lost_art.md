> This is me rambling about life, my day-to-day encounter with problems, and navigating hurdles. This is completely raw, unfiltered thoughts so bear with me.

Phew...Been a while I wrote on this blog. I can literally see how dusty and old it is.

Its been over 3 years since I posted, 3 years I lost my spark for writing. A lot has happened over the years, so much so that I'm not sure I can fit all in writing. I will try to highlight some of the notable ones in upcoming posts. 

I know you are probably wondering why I came back to the limelight all of a sudden. I mean, why now? For the first time in 3 years, I can now afford the time and space to be still. Let me explain. 

2020-2021, my entire identity was centered around work; I had no life outside my 9-5. Not the best but I had to make that sacrifice to kickstart my career. 2022, I learnt about work-life balance. I loved the idea of having a life outside my 9-5 so I decided to embrace this new way of living. This was - and still is - exciting but it comes with a lot of noise. For the past 3 years, I haven't had the motivation to write. I've been so eager to live and enjoy life that I rarely even remember I own a personal blog haha! This lifestyle is fun, no doubt but it came at a cost: I lost my art. For me, that art is writing. And so, I have made a decision to revive it.

Going forward, I will spend some time during my weekends to reflect on life, career, and overall well-being so expect to see more content in the coming weeks! Stay tuned.
