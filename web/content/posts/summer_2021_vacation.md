# Yay! It's summer time!

It feels so good to finally go on a long vacation after 6 months of work.

I have been waiting for this day to come lol.

As for my holiday plans, I just want to rest and do absolutely nothing! Will do my best to resist every urge to do any work during this 2 weeks of chill. Aside from resting, I plan to visit few places and friends. I plan to do alot of swimming as well.

Keep an eye on this post because I will keep updating it with summer event photos. Also, watch out for that summer body ;)
