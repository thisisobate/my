> This is me rambling about life, my day-to-day encounter with problems, and navigating hurdles. This is completely unfiltered thoughts so bear with me.

I recently moved out of my parents home to start my own life as a bachelor of course. I was excited, but at the same time, I was worrried about how I was gonna live on my own. Mehn...I thought it was gonna be easy for me to coexist with myself but nahh..it's been crazy! I've had to figure out food myself, my safety, health, and sanity as well. It's a tough ride I must say. You know, I used to think older people has this life thing all figured out but it seems that it isn't the case.

Living is an everyday struggle, and of course it comes with its own challenges. Now, I'm beginning to see how powerful decisions are, and how our decisions can make or mar us. We all, regardless of age, accomplishment, or social status, are still figuring this life thing out. I used to take every opinion my parents or elders gave to me as always being right. I do this because I believed they've already figured out life and I could just learn from their experiences.

Nowadays, I've realized that it's called Life for a reason, an opportunity to try things out, make decisions on my own, and Learn along the way.
